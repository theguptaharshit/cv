        <p>Hey there! I'm Harshit Gupta, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science at Galgotias University.<br><br>I'm all about computer science magic. You know, those lines of code that make the digital world tick. Ever since I got my hands on Java back in school, I've been hooked on the thrill of coding and problem-solving. <br><br>Fast forward to today, and I'm diving deep into the world of Computer Science Engineering, turning my passion into my career path. You'll often find me immersed in algorithms and programming languages, tackling challenges with a logical twist. But hey, I'm not just a tech geek – I'm all about making a difference too. I've actively participated in the National Service Scheme, dedicating myself to rural development and community awareness. Whether it's brainstorming innovative ideas with the Institute's Innovation Council or leading a team at Doubtfree for educational initiatives, I've learned that computer science isn't just about bits and bytes; it's about creating real-world impact and contributing to social service.<br><br>Moreover, I believe that understanding the financial dimensions is crucial. I've gained insights into financial markets and investment strategies through active involvement in mutual funds. I'm passionate about promoting responsible financial practices and empowering peers with financial literacy knowledge. With this holistic approach, I'm equipped to evaluate projects not only for their technical feasibility but also for their financial sustainability and positive societal impact. I'm convinced that in today's digital landscape, computer science is the superhero cape we need to tackle modern challenges. So, let's ride the wave of technology and make a positive dent in the universe one line of code at a time!</p>
